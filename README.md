## ME-VLM: Visual-Language Model for Micro-expression Synthesis and Classification


**ME-VLM** is a synthetic video dataset generated using the LTX-Video image-to-video model. It uses high-quality facial images from the CelebA-HQ dataset as input and generates short video clips along with automatically generated captions. The dataset is intended for non-commercial academic research in multimodal learning, video generation, and captioning.
